# Instance-based Algorithms

Instance-based learning model is a decision problem with instances or examples of training data that are deemed important or required to the model.

Such methods typically build up a database of example data and compare new data to the database using a similarity measure in order to find the best match and make a prediction. For this reason, instance-based methods are also called winner-take-all methods and memory-based learning. Focus is put on the representation of the stored instances and similarity measures used between instances.

The most popular instance-based algorithms are:
* k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
* Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)
* Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
* Locally Weighted Learning (LWL)
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
